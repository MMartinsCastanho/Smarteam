    <h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is your Team menu!</p>
    <p>The <b>Team</b> is a group of friends or co-workers you usually play with.</p>
    <p>With <b>Smarteam</b>, you can easily split the players in 2 balanced sides before every game you play with them, and play more fun and challenging games.</p>
    <p>In order to do that, you simply have to keep updating the results of every game you play with your Team in Smarteam.</p>
    <p>After every result update, the individual <b>Score</b> of each player in the Team is calculated.</p>
    <p>This Score is then used to obtain the most balanced <b>Lineups</b> for your next game.</p>
    <p>You can also check who is the star of the group and who is the donkey by consulting the <b>Ranking</b> at any time.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Edit Team</h2>
    <p>Here you can <b>Add</b> or <b>Delete players</b> from your Team, and <b>Rename</b> any player or the Team itself.</p>
    <p>Start by adding some players in your Team!</p>
    <h2>Add Result</h2>
    <p>After you have played a game with your team, select whether the game has ended in a draw or not, and then select the players that have played on each side in the game.</p>
    <h2>Ranking</h2>
    <p>Here you can consult the Score of every player in the Team and see who are the best players and who... isn't doing so well.</p>
    <h2>Lineups</h2>
    <p>Use this option <b>before</b> playing a game to obtain a balanced split of players in 2 sides of equal strength.</p>
    <p>Select the players that will be playing and see how Smarteam chooses who plays against who.</p>
    <p>The lineups are not saved, so you and your friends can make any arrangements you want in the sides, and in the end update the result with the sides you ended up playing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Have fun!</p>
